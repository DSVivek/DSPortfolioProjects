# [Project 1: Analyzing a Marketing Campaign: Project Overview](https://github.com/DSVivek/DSPortfolioProjects)
In this project i will translate common business questions into measurable outcomes, including "How did this marketing campaign perform?", "Which channel is referring the most subscribers?", "Why is a particular channel underperforming?" and more using a Marketing dataset based on the data of an online subscription business. In this project i am going to use Python and Pandas fundamentals, such as merging/slicing datasets, groupby(), correcting data types and visualizing results using matplotlib
